# There are currently three strategies that I have developed as personal projects
  1. PumpAndDumpShort - A strategy with the concept of identifying anomalous pumps on stocks and shorting on the way back down
  2. TrendFollowing - A strategy that uses a host of trend indicators that was constructed to make the highest returns possible in a quarter - Won 2nd and 3rd in QuantConnect's student competitions
  3. MACrossover - Another trend strategy that I developed that focuses on MA crossovers and other trend indicators
